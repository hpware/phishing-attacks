This repo contains a few phishing emails link html's that I got in my inbox, Some of these are already parsed and made to not work.
This repo does not violate computer misuse acts, as you can just get the HTML document via view-source in Google Chrome or Firefox, and this is made with good fath to let people know what scam websites do to everyone.
